# ajm_discord
A collection of several cogs for Discord bots with a few common methods/commands.

# Cogs

## BaseCog
Intentionally sparse cog, just contains an easy way to log and send messages.

## ListenerCog
Cog for listeners. Only the on_ready one does anything at the moment, really. TODO

## DeleteCog
Cog for deleting bot messages in bulk on the user side.

## TextCog
Cog for retrieving text. Specifically from Discord threads. Can retrieve text from .txt files, Discord messages, Discord embeds, and google doc links. Planning to add functionality to retrieve text from MS Word files as well.
